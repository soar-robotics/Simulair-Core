.. note::
    Prerequisites -- The following is required for this tutorial

    * Unity3D last stable version
    * Docker and docker-compose
    * ROS2 dependencies
    * Ð¡loned this repository `unity_ros2`_.

The goal of this tutorial is to get the turtlebot3 sample scene up and running and to explore some of the features in unity_ros2.

Getting a Unity Project with ROS2 support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to ``~/UnityRos2/Assets`` and run ``python3 start_editor.py``. This script sets environment variables and starts the Unity Editor. Don't use sudo. This is only way to start the Editor with ROS2 support at the moment. Opening the project through Unity Hub is not supported yet.

Unity should now look similar to the image above. (Depending on your layout settings for Unity).
Double click on `Turtlebot3NavigationDemo` located under ``Assets/Scenes`` in the `Project` window.

Press the `Play` button to start the simulation.

If everything is working, there should be no error messages in the Console.

To teleop the turtlebot3 with your keyboard (wasd or arrows), navigate to `Inspector` window then click `Add Component`. Find `Unity Input Teleop` and select it. Then navigate to `Game` window and press navigation buttons.

If everything is fine TurtleBot3 must move.

Running navigation2 for turtlebot3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way (in my opinion...) to test the navigation2 stack with turtlebot3 and unity_ros2 is to use our precompiled docker image from DockerHub. Navigate to ``~/UnityRos2/docker/turtlebot3_navigation`` folder and run ``docker-compose up`` command to  start docker building. The first time it's will take about an hour

Navigation2 stack starting automatically. You should eventually see something like this in the terminal window.

For next time to launch the container use ``docker-compose up --build`` command. 

Sending navigation goals from Unity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For send navigation2 goal position navigate to `Inspector` window then click `Add Component`. Find `Move Base Goal Publisher` and select it.

Now that everything is up and running, we should be able to send some navigation goals to the robot.
Start by selecting a `NavigationGoal` in the `Hierarch` window in Unity, then enter some goal position and press `Send Navigation Goal` in the `Inspector` window.
